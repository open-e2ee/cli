description: Use this skill to activate or change the Production environment of an OpenE2EE Relay project with the oe CLI. It covers the Production section of open-e2ee.config.ts, oe config push --dry-run, and oe config push --yes. Use it when a person asks to go to Production, or when the oe CLI returns CARD_REQUIRED, BILLING_PERMISSION_REQUIRED, FREE_PROJECT_LIMIT, or TERMS_REQUIRED for a push.

# OpenE2EE Relay Production

A project has a Sandbox environment from `oe new`. Production joins the
project only when `open-e2ee.config.ts` has a Production section. The first
push with that section activates Production on the Free plan. The activation
uses one of the two Free Production projects of the organization.

## Rules

- Switch on `code`. Do not parse the text of `error`.
- Run `oe config push --dry-run` before each push that changes Production.
- Pass `--yes` only after the person agrees to use one of the two Free
  Production slots of the organization.
- When `action.url` is present, give the URL to the person. The person must
  open it.
- A push never deactivates Production. Do not remove the Production section
  to stop Production.

## Activate Production

1. Add the Production section under `environments` in
   `open-e2ee.config.ts`:

   ```ts
   environments: {
     sandbox: { /* keep this section */ },
     production: {},
   },
   ```

2. Run `oe config push --dry-run`. In
   `data.environments.production`, `activation` is `free` for an
   activation. `blockedBy` names a gate that stops the activation.
3. Show the changes to the person. Tell the person that the activation uses
   one of the two Free Production slots of the organization.
4. Run `oe config push --yes` only after the person agrees.
5. Read `data.environments.production.status`. `applied` means that
   Production is active.

`oe config push` writes the Production Relay connection URL to
`.env.production.local`. If the host of the app does not read that file,
tell the person to set the same variable in the production build
environment. Do not print the value.

## Change Production

1. Edit the Production values in `open-e2ee.config.ts`.
2. Run `oe config push --dry-run`, and show the changes to the person.
3. Run `oe config push --yes` only after the person agrees.

## Codes

The activation checks the gates in this order: the billing permission, the
terms, the Free plan slot, and the card.

| `code`                        | What to do                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`       | A Production change needs `--yes`. Show the changes to the person. Run `next` only after the person agrees.                                                 |
| `BILLING_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` | This account does not have the billing permission. Tell the person that a billing administrator must run the push or grant the permission. `next` is empty. |
| `TERMS_REQUIRED`              | The organization did not accept the terms. Use the terms steps of the `open-e2ee-relay-setup` skill. Then run the command in `data.retry`.                  |
| `FREE_PROJECT_LIMIT`          | The organization already has two Free Production projects. Tell the person to change a plan in the console, then run the push again. `next` is empty.       |
| `CARD_REQUIRED`               | The organization has no card. Give `action.url` to the person. After the person adds a card, run `next`.                                                    |
